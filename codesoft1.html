                    Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development,<br>
                    including the front end and back end. The front end consists of the user interface,<br>
                    and the back end takes care of the business logic and application workflows.<br>
                    <p>
                    Consider a retail website. Users can browse or purchase specific items, delete oradd <br>
                    items in cart, change their profile, and do many other things. All these actions require<br>
                     a front-end user interface (UI), as well as some business logic, written in the back-end.<br>
                     The website UI can be built using various, front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The back end is written in programming languages like Java or Python. Further,  <br>
                     a goodweb application would need scalability, event handling, and routing, which <br>
                     are usually  handled by libraries and frameworks like SpringBoot or Django.
